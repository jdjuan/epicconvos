Future:

-Create urls for users and specific convos
-Allow the user to upload a picture and get the text from it
-Allow users to set the theme of the convo: Tinder, iMessage, Messenger, WhatsApp
-Allow users to use a different set of emoticons
-Improve upvote and downvote precision quality
-Create an algorithm to better sort most epic convos
--Even farther:
---Allow users to follow other users
---Let users be notified when they upload a conversation

Advantages:
-Inspiration for your own conversations
-When you want to show off a conversation, you will no longer need to blur the pictures or anything else.
-It will reach a wider community, instead of just earning likes on facebook

Disadvantages:
-It will not feel like a real conversation since it is not a screencapture
--This can be solved by imititating the look&feel as much as possible
